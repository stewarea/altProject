##Description

Icons representing the content they are affiliated with are clicked by the user in order to create an array
which is then pushed to a Google Maps API that is centered (at times) on Portland Oregon.

##Setup/Installation Requirements

1.)Click play button.

2.)Make selections.

3.)Click search icon.

## Bugs/Problems

If users select too many options, the map which is created is pushed out to the 'error' map which is the world map.

This is because there are conflicting cardinal directions, and in general, too much information to provide a useful search.

## Support and contact details

If there are any problems shoot me an e-mail: stewarea@gmail.com

## Technologies Used

JS, Jquery, HTML, CSS

## Interesting Code

Jumbotron Narrow is a template created by the team at Bootstrap and was used as the scaffolding for the entire project.

Google Maps API is also used as a 'search engine' to help desplay the appropriate content based on the user's choices.
